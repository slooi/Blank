# Blank
A blank page to populate with Japanese text with hotkey convenience features. This is to be used in conjunction with an extention that pastes content automatically from your clipboard.

# Hotkeys
d - **D**eletes highlighted text

c - **C**hanges highlighted text to user input (if the field is left empty no changes will be done)

x - Toggle between the chiisai and normal versions of the kana (eg: あ=>ぁ, ぁ=>あ, つ=>っ)

z - Toggles the dakuten of the kana if possible (eg: か=>が, が=>か, す=>ず, つ=>づ)

# Potental Gotchas
1) Convenience features only work for text pasted together (eg: if you copy multiple lines *seperately* by doing ctl+c twice, once for each line, you wil not be able to use *d* hotkey to delete them all at once. You'd have to delete each line individually.)
