# Blank
A blank page to populate with Japanese text with hotkey convenience features. This is to be used in conjunction with an extention that pastes content automatically from your clipboard.

# Hotkeys
d - **D**eletes highlighted text

c - **C**hanges highlighted text to user input (if the field is left empty no changes will be done)

x - Toggle between the chiisai and normal versions of the kana (eg: あ=>ぁ, ぁ=>あ, つ=>っ, ィ=>イ)

z - Toggles the dakuten of the kana if possible (eg: か=>が, が=>か, す=>ず, つ=>づ, フ=>プ)

# Potental Gotchas
1) Hotkey convenience features don't work across multiple pasted text simutaneously, you'll have to edit each group of pasted text individually. For example, if you copy two lines of text *seperately* by presing ctl+c twice - once for each line - you wil not be able to use *d* hotkey to delete both lines all at once. You'd have to delete each line individually.
